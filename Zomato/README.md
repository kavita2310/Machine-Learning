<h1>Zomato Data Analysis</h1>

This project we have name, online order, book table, rate, votes, approx cost(for two people), listed in(type). 
The goal is to developed machine learning models build and evaluate to predict key metrics and trends. 

Project Overview:<br>
              Analyze Zomato restaurant data to gain insights into customer preferences, restaurant rating, votes, cost.

Key Analysis Performed:<br>

•	Restaurant rating distribution<br>
•	Online ordering vs booking tables<br>
•	Approximate cost distribution<br>
•	Relationship between rating and approximate cost<br>
•	Top rated restaurats<br>

Data Set<br>

The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
•	Name: Restaurant Name<br>
•	Online Order: YES/NO<br>
•	Book Table: YES/NO<br>
•	Votes: Customer giving votes for restaurant<br>
•	Approx Cost: Approximate Cost for two person<br>
•	Listed in(type): Restaurant type are buffet, cafes, other, dining<br>
•	Rate: Restaurant Rating, 1-5<br>

Technologies used:<br>

•	Python<br>
•	Pandas<br>
•	Seaborn<br>
•	Matplotlib<br>
•	Jupiter Notebook<br>

Deliverables:<br>

•	Comprehensive report detailing key finding and insights.<br>
•	Visualizations (plots, charts) illustrating restaurant rating, online ordering and cost trends.<br>
•	Recommendations for restaurants.<br>


Methodology:<br>

•	Data cleaning and preprocessing.<br>
•	Exploratory data analysis(EDA).<br>
•	Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.<br>
•	Statistical analysis.<br>

Model Evaluation Metrics:<br>

•	Bar graph: Majority of the restaurant falls in dinning category.<br>
•	Line graph: Dining restaurant has received maximum votes.<br>
•	Histogram: The majority restaurants received rating from 3.5 to 4.<br>
•	Count plot: the majority of couples preferred restaurants with an approximate cost of 300 rupees.<br> 
•	Box plot: Offline order received lower rating in comparison to online order.<br>
•	Heat map: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, where cafe primarily receive online order.<br> 
This suggests that clients prefer order in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.<br>
