<h1>Loan Application Credit Risk Analysis-KNN(ML+Python)</h1>
 
This project aims to predict the credit risk of lone applicants Prediction based on their demographic and 
financial characteristics such as age, total work experience, number of years in city, cost to request ration, 
cibil score, over draft past 12 months, total bounce past 12 months. The goal is to developed  machine learning 
model that can accurately forecast  the credit risk of lone applicants.

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>
To develop a KNN- based machine learning model that predicts the credit risk of lone applicants based on 
their demographic and financial characteristics. This project explores va machine learning algorithms KNN  
to predict the credit risk of lone applicants and provides insights into which features are most important 
in influencing credit risk.

<h1>Key Analysis Performed:</h1>
•	Collect and clean Lone applicant credit risk data, including age, total work experience and additional info.<br>
•	Build and evaluate KNN  machine learning models to predict credit risk of lone applicants.<br>

<h1>Data Set</h1>
The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
•	Age: Customers age.<br>
•	Total work experience: Total work experience of customers (1, 2, 3, etc).<br>
•	Number of years in city: Number of years in city of customers (1, 2, 3, etc).<br>
•	Cost to request ratio: Costs of running a mutual scheme in relation to its total assets.<br>
•	CIBIL score: Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited score.<br>
•	Overdraft past 12 months: Past 12 months of over drafts.<br>
•	Total bounce past 12 months: Past 12 months of total bounce.<br>

<h1>Technologies used:</h1>
•	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulating and processing.<br>
•	Matplotlib and Seabone for data visualization and analysis.<br>
•	Machine Learning: Evaluate KNN machine learning models.<br>
•	Python used for data analysis and model building.<br>


<h1>Model Evaluation Metrics:</h1>
•	Scatter chart: Age by Total work experience.<br>
•	Box plot: Age, CIBIL Score.<br>
•	Accuracy score: 0.6436.<br>
•	Display training and testing score.<br>

<h1>Insights and Findings:</h1>
•	According to credit risk of lone  the most effected columns is age, total work experience, number of years in city, cost to request ratio, CIBIL score.<br>
•	Accuracy score is 0.6436.<br>
•	Train score is 0.6746.<br>
•	Test score is 0.6436.<br>
•	Improved credit risk assessment: The KNN model will enable lenders to accurately assess the credit risk of lone applicants.<br>
•	Reduced default rates: By identifying high-risk applicants, lenders can reduce default rates and minimize losses.<br>
•	Increased efficiency: The KNN model will automate the credit risk assessment process, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency.<br>
