### Flight Fare Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project aims to predict Flight Fare Price Prediction based on historical data and various influencing factors such as airline,Date_of_Journey,Source,Destination,Route,Dep_Time,	Arrival_Time,Duration,Total_Stops,Additional_Info,Price.The goal is to devlop machine learning model that can accurately forcast ticket price to help travelers make informed decisions and a flight  optimize pricing strategirs.

# Project Overview

Flight ticket prices fluctuate based on several variables, including travel season, demand, time before departure and other factors. This project explores various machine learning algorithms to predict flight prices and provides insights into which features are most important in influencing prices.

# Key Anaiysis Performed:
•	Collect and clean historical fight data, including ticket price,routes and additional_info.
•	Identify key features affecting price fluctuations.
•	Build and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict flight prices.
•	Compare model perfomance to select the best approach for price prediction.

# Data Set
The dataset use for this project contains information such as:
.   Airline: IndiGo,Air India,Jet Airways,SpiceJet,Multiple carriers,GoAir,Vistara,Air Asia,ect.
.   Date of Journey: The day on which the journey begins.
.   Source: A person where something comes.(Banglore,Kolkata,Delhi,etc)
.   Destination: The place where person is going.(Kolkata,Munbai,Cochin,etc)
.   Route: A way from one place to another.
.   Departure time: The time at which a public conveyance is scheduled to depart from a given point of origin. 
.   Arrival time: The time when a person  scheduled to arrive at a destination, or has arrived.
.   Duration: How long its flight.
.   Total stops: How mant stop they have.
.   Additional_Info: What kind they have extra imformation.
.   Price: Price of the fight they pay.
# Technologies used:
.  Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulating and processing.
.  Matplotlib and Seabone for data visualization and analysis.
.  Machine Learning: Evaluate multiple machine learning models.
.  Python used for data analysis and model building.

# Model Evaluation Metrics:

. Score: The goodness of fit.
. Bar graph: What columns are very important.
. Root mean squared error(RMSE): To meassure prediction error.
. Mean Absolute Error(MEA): To assume prediction accuracy.
