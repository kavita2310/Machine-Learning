<h1>Airline Customers Satisfaction Analysis using Decision Trees.(Machine Learning+Python)</h1>

This project aims to predict the Airline customers satisfaction  Prediction based on their demographic and financial 
characteristics such as gender, customs type, age, flight distance, satisfaction, etc. The goal is to developed  machine 
learning model that can accurately forecast  the Customers satisfaction.

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>

To develop a DECISION TREE  based machine learning model that predicts the customer satisfaction based on 
their demographic and financial characteristics. This project explores  machine learning algorithms DECISION TREE  
to predict the customers satisfaction based on their demographic, travel and service experience characteristics.

<h1>Key Analysis Performed:</h1>

•	Collect and clean Airline customer satisfaction analysis data, including class, flight distance, departure and additional info.<br>
•	Build and evaluate Decision Tree  machine learning models to predict customers satisfaction.<br>
•	Using LableEncoder to encoding data.<br>
•	Using StandardScaler to scaling data.<br>

<h1>Data Set:</h1>

The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
•	id : Unique id number to each passenger.<br>
•	Gender: Gender of the passengers. (Female, Male)<br>
•	Customer Type: The customer type. (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)<br>
•	Age: The actual age of the passengers.<br>
•	Type of Travel: Purpose of the flight of the passengers. (Personal Travel, Business Travel)<br>
•	Class: Travel class in the plane of the passengers.(Business, Eco, Eco Plus)<br>
•	Flight distance: The flight distance of this journey.<br>
•	In flight wi-fi service: Satisfaction level of the in flight wi-fi service. (0:Not Applicable;1-5)<br>

•	Cleanliness: Satisfaction level of Cleanliness.<br>
•	Departure Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when departure.<br>
•	Arrival Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when Arrival.<br>
•	Satisfaction: Airline satisfaction level.(Satisfaction, neutral or dissatisfaction)<br>

<h1>Technologies used:</h1>

•	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulating and processing.<br>
•	Matplotlib and Seabone for data visualization and analysis.<br>
•	Machine Learning: Evaluate DECISION TREE machine learning models.<br>
•	Python used for data analysis and model building.<br>


<h1>Model Evaluation Metrics:</h1>

•	Bar chart of customer satisfaction.<br>
•	Box plot: Flight distance, Check in service.<br>
•	Prepare Heat map.<br>
•	Accuracy score: 0.86.<br>
•	Display training and testing score.<br>
•	Recall score: 0.84.<br>
•	F1 score: 0.85.<br>
•	Make a Decision tree.<br>



<h1>Insights and Findings:</h1>

•	Accuracy score is 0.84.<br>
•	Train score is 0.8615.<br>
•	Test score is 0.8601.<br>
•	Recall score is 0.84.<br>
•	F1 score is 0.85.<br>
•	Improve customer satisfaction: By identifying the key factors that contribute to customer satisfaction airline 
can improve their services and increase customer loyalty.<br>
•	Increased efficiency: The DECISION TREE model can help airline to identify areas where they can improve their 
services, reducing the need for manual analysis and increasing efficiency.<br>
