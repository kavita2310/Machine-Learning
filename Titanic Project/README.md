###  Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning)
 This project aims to predict survival person based on historical data and various influencing factors such as  Passenger  id,  Survived, p class,  sex, Age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked.. The goal  is to develop machine learning model that can accurately forecast survival person  to help the prediction  make informed decisions and survival person.  

# Project Overview

Titanic Survival Prediction  the probability of survival for each passenger based on provided features.<br>
Passenger class strongly influences survival. Women and  children have higher survival rates.<br>
# Key Analysis Performed:<br>
•	Collect and clean historical survival titanic  data  including Passenger  id,  Survived, p class,  sex, Age, etc.<br>
•	Identify key features affecting of  survival person.<br>
•	Build and evaluate Logistic Regression  machine learning models to predict  survival person.<br>
•	Compare model performance to select the best approach for survival person prediction.<br>
# Data Set <br>
The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
Passenger id : Self Explanatory<br>
Survived : Self Explanatory <br>
P class : Ticket class<br>
Sex : Sex<br>
Age:  Age in years<br>
Sibsp :	 # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic <br>
Parch : # of parents / children aboard the Titanic <br>
Ticket :	 Ticket number <br>
Fare : Passenger fare <br>
Cabin :	 Cabin number <br>
Embarked : Port of Embarkation <br>

# Technologies used:<br>
.  Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulating and processing.<br>
.  Matplotlib and Seabone for data visualization and analysis.<br>
.  Machine Learning: Evaluate multiple machine learning models.<br>
.  Python used for data analysis and model building.<br>

# Model Evaluation Metrics:<br>

Confusion matrix: Model is performing by comparing its predicted values to the actual values.<br>
Classification report: Evaluate the performance of a classification model.<br>
Accuracy score:  How often a model prediction are correct.<br>
Precision score: How often a model correctly predicts a positive class.<br>
Recall score: How well a model can identify positive instances in a dataset.<br>
Area Under the Curve(AUC) score: Model can distinguish between positive and negative classes.<br> 
Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve(ROC): Classifier performs across all possible classification thresholds.<br>
