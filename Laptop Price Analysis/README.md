<h1>Laptop Price Prediction Analysis</h1>

The dataset at hand provides a comprehensive compilation of
information concerning a diverse array of laptops, encompassing a
spectrum of specifications and corresponding prices. Crafted with
the aim of facilitating sales price prediction, this dataset offers
invaluable insights into the intricate details of laptops, ranging from
processor specifications to display attributes. 

<h1>Project  overview:</h1>

Develop a machine learning model to analyze Laptop price prediction, 
rating and recommend laptop based on user preferences. 
This project explores various machine learning algorithms to 
predict Laptop price and provides insights into which features are most important in influencing prices.
