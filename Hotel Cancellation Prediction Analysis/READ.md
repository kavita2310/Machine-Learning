<h1>Hotel Cancellation Prediction Analysis-Random Forest( Machine Learning+Python)</h1>

This project aims to predict the Hotel Cancellation based on their demographic and financial characteristics such hotel, 
is lead time, arrival date year, etc. The goal is to developed machine learning model that can accurately forecast the Hotel cancellations reason.

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>
To develop a RANDOM FOREST based machine learning model that predicts the Hotel cancellations based on their demographic 
and financial characteristics. This project explores machine learning algorithms RANDOM FOREST to predict the Hotel cancellations 
based on various factors such as lead time, arrival date, guest information and booking details.

 <h1>Key Analysis Performed:</h1>
•	Collect and clean Hotel Cancellations prediction data, including adult, arrival date year, hotel, country, distribution channel and additional info.<br>
•	Build and evaluate RANDOM FOREST machine learning models to predict Hotel cancellations.<br>

<h1>Data Set</h1>
The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
•	Hotel: Hotel name.<br>
•	Is cancelled: Hotel is cancelled or not.<br>
•	Lead time: The time between a guest making a reservation and their check-in date.<br>
•	Arrival date year: Arrival years.<br>
•	Arrival date month: Arrival months.<br>
•	Arrival date week number: Arrival week of number.<br>
•	Arrival date day of month: Arrival day of months.<br>

•	Prepare Heat map.<br>
•	Accuracy score: 1.00.<br>
•	Display training and testing score.<br>
•	Recall score: 1.00.<br>
•	F1 score: 1.00.<br>
•	Find the confusion matrix.<br>
•	Find the classification report.<br>
•	Prepare heat map.<br>

<h1>Insights and Findings:</h1>
•	Accuracy score is 1.00.<br>
•	Train score is 1.00.<br>
•	Test score is 0.9999.<br>
•	Recall score is 1.00.<br>
•	F1 score is 1.00.<br>
•	Improve revenue management: By accurately predicting hotel cancellation, hotel can optimize their revenue management strategies.<br>
•	Enhance customer experience: By identifying guests who are likely to cancel, hotels can proactively offer personalized services to improve their experience.<br>
•	Reduced operational costs: By minimizing the impact of cancellations, hotel can reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.<br>
