<h1>Lone Status Classification using Naïve Bayes.(Machine Learning+Python)</h1>

This project aims to predict the Default status Prediction based on their demographic and financial 
characteristics such as id, limit bal, age, bill amt1,pay amt1,default status, etc. The goal is to 
developed machine learning model that can accurately forecast the Default status.

<h1>Project Overview:</h1>
To develop a NAÏVE BAYES based machine learning model that predicts the Default status based on their 
demographic and financial characteristics. This project explores machine learning algorithms NAÏVE BAYES to 
predict the Default status based on customer credit information.

<h1>Key Analysis Performed:</h1>
•	Collect and clean Lone status classification data, including id, limit bal, age, bill amt1, pay amt1, default status and additional info.
•	Build and evaluate Naïve bayes machine learning models to predict Default status.


<h1>Data Set:</h1>

The dataset use for this project contains information such as:<br>
•	ID: Customer id number.<br>
•	Limit Bal:Limit ob bal.<br>
•	Age: Customer age.<br>
•	Bill Amt1: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 1.<br>
•	Bill Amt2: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 2.<br>
•	Bill Amt3: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 3.<br>
•	Bill Amt4: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 4.<br>
•	Bill Amt5: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 5.<br>
•	Bill Amt6: Alternative Minimum Tax of bill 6.<br>
•	Pay Amt1: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 1.<br>
•	Pay Amt2: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 2.<br>
•	Pay Amt3: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 3.<br>
•	Pay Amt4: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 4.<br>
•	Pay Amt5: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 5.<br>
•	Pay Amt6: Alternative Minimum Tax of pay 6.<br>
•	Default status: Default and non default status.<br>


<h1>Technologies used:</h1>

•	Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulating and processing.<br>
•	Matplotlib and Seabone for data visualization and analysis.<br>
•	Machine Learning: Evaluate NAÏVE BAYES machine learning models.<br>
•	Python used for data analysis and model building.<br>


<h1>Model Evaluation Metrics:</h1>

•	Box plot: Limit bal, Age.<br>
•	Prepare Heat map.<br>
•	Accuracy score: 0.75.<br>
•	Display training and testing score.<br>
•	Recall score: 0.9590.<br>
•	F1 score: 0.68.<br>
•	Precision score:0.7745.<br>
•	Find the confusion matrix.<br>
•	Find the classification report.<br>

<h1>Insights and Findings:</h1>

•	Accuracy score is 0.75.<br>
•	Train score is 0.7531.<br>
•	Test score is 0.7511.<br>
•	Recall score is 0.9590.<br>
•	F1 score is 0.68.<br>
•	Precision score is 0.7745.<br>
•	Improve risk assessment: By accurately classifying lone status, financial institution can improve their risk assessment and 
decision making processes.<br>
•	Reduced default rates: By identifying high risk customers, financial institution can take proactive measures to reduce default rates.<br>
•	Increased efficiency: The NAÏVE BAYES model can help financial institutions to automate their risk assessment processes increasing 
efficiency and reducing manual effort.<br>
